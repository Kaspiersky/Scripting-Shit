Most of this shit I made with AI because I can't code.

# What is UNC or sUNC? What does Level 7/6/8 and etc mean on my executor?
Well first of all...
## UNC
is the test of how many functions your executor supports
in order for a script to work.
## sUNC
on the other hand, verifies whether those functions work as intended.
This is useful when the little shits who work on such executors (such as those at Xeno) decide they want to
be lazy and not actually implement the functions so they fake it.
# Well what about Executor Levels?
They are called a **"Thread Identity"**.
This basically means the level of "Permissions" that your executor has.

TL;DR: The higher your executors level is the more stuff you can access accompanied with functions.
